# Dockerfile - identify
- FROM → Sets the base image for the container (e.g., FROM python:3.9).
- WORKDIR → Sets the working directory inside the container.
- COPY → Copies files from the host machine to the container.
- ADD → Similar to COPY, but also extracts compressed files and supports URLs.
- RUN → Executes a command during the image build process (e.g., install dependencies).
- ENV → Sets environment variables inside the container.
- EXPOSE → Declares which port the container listens on (but doesn’t publish it).
- USER → Sets the user that runs inside the container (e.g., USER node).
- CMD → Provides the default command to run when the container starts.
- ENTRYPOINT → Defines a fixed executable that always runs, even if CMD is overridden.



# differentiate chmod and chown
- chmod	
    - Changes file permissions (who can read, write, or execute)	
    - chmod 755 script.sh (Owner: all permissions, Others: read & execute)
- chown	
    - Changes file ownership (who owns the file)	
    - chown app:app myfile.txt (Sets app as owner and group)

/*
    Notes:
        - you do this so you can see your changes after refresh VS building a new image
        - this will take very long time
            - thats why you need docker log -f to see if it finally done/finish setting up
*/
> cd C:\Users\Kael\Documents\Visual Studio Code\Docker Pracs\dockertest03
> docker run -d -p 7000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app --name applestart react-app
> docker logs -f applestart
OR add "" if path has space
> docker run -d -p 7001:3000 -v "%cd%":/app --name applestart react-app
> docker logs -f applestart
OR there is some issue in the webpack and you need to add -e WATCHPACK_POLLING=true and refresh to see the update
> docker run -d -p 7001:3000 -v %cd%:/app --name redsalamander -e WATCHPACK_POLLING=true react-app
> docker run -d -p 7002:3000 -v "%cd%":/app --name greensalamander -e WATCHPACK_POLLING=true react-app
> docker logs -f greensalamander
